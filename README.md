Legal notes
-----------

- The project doesn't contain ***any*** original assets from the game!
- To use this project you need to have an original copy of the game (bought from [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/474960/Quantum_Break/)), the project doesn't make piracy easier and doesn't break any of the DRM included in-game.
